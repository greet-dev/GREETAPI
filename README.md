GREET-API
=========

GREET is now capable of loading plugin in order to extend functionalities. We do appreciate any comments that may help us improving.

This repository contains examples of plugins that have been developed using the API.

In order to familiarize yourself with the available methods and objects we created examples available from the archive. 
- Example1 lists all pathways and allows you to observe the total GHGs for a selected pathway. 
- Example2 allows the user to find a parameter and change the user value by the model, then allows to run another simulation.
- Example3 shows how to retrieve default and user value from a parameter.
- Example4 shows how to create new pathways, processes, vehicles programatically and add them to the database
 
Starting 2015, some tools have been added to demonstrate how to use the libraries directly in order to load the datafile, run simulations and extract the results. There is also a tool that demonstrate how to modify the data file directly in order to update references for the resource used on some input.
You can use these examples as reference to create other tools arround GREET.

WARNING: The API has evolved over the years, please select the appropriate folder for further instructions.
We're keeping the old folder for people working with older versions of the software but it's always recomended to use the latest version in order to enjoy the latest updates and bug fixes.
