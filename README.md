GREET-API
=========

GREET is now capable of loading plugin in order to extend functionalities. We do appreciate any comments that may help us improving.

This repository contains examples of plugins that have been developed using the API.

In order to familiarize yourself with the available methods and objects we created examples available from the archive. 
- Example1 lists all pathways and allows you to observe the total GHGs for a selected pathway. 
- Example2 allows the user to find a parameter and change the user value by the model, then allows to run another simulation.
- Example3 shows how to retrieve default and user value from a parameter.

WARNING: The API has been changed between GREET 2013 and GREET 2014, please select the appropriate folder for further instructions.
